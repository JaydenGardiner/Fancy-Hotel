# Fancy Hotel
Hotel reservation system developed for CS 4400 Intro to Databases.

I used a basic HTML/CSS template and coded both front end and back end.

I coded all HTML files and all PHP files (featuring embedded SQL). I coded all Javascript embedded in HTML files and slightly modified the CSS derived from a html5up.net theme.

I used XAMPP to run a locally hosted database populated by the Create Table and Insert SQL statements in Queries.txt.

All coding was done by me (aside from database population Insert statements in Queries.txt), while my teammates Joe Sadler and Vishaak Ravi produced design deliverables such as an ER diagram and relational schema model.
